It includes transaction \r\nmanagement functions (routines, verbs); request/response, conversational, queuing, and publish-and-subscribe message-handling\r\nfunctions; service interface functions; and buffer management functions for distributed application communication.\r\n\r\nATMI++ is a C++ wrapping of this API,  adding strong typing of FML buffers and adding the use of exceptions to detect and handle error conditions. \r\nThis should help making it easier to write fast and rock solid Tuxedo software.\r\n\r\nThis project is currently hosted <a href=\"http://herbertkoelman.github.com/cpp-atmi\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n### Setting things up\r\n\r\n    $ configure\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nThis documentation is obtained :\r\n\r\n    $ make doxygen\r\n\r\nSuggestions or bug reporting can be done <a href=\"mailto:herbert.koelman@me.com\">here</a>\r\n\r\n###  Dependencies\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n ATMI++ is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n ATMI++ is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
