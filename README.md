Tuxedo ATMI C++ wrapper
============

The ATMI library comes as c set of libraries, ATMI++ offers a c++ wrapping of this library making it easier to write shorter and more robust Tuxedo code.

Tuxedo (Transactions for Unix, Extended for Distributed Operations) is a middleware platform used to manage distributed transaction processing in distributed computing environments. Tuxedo is a transaction processing system or transaction-oriented middleware, or enterprise application server for a variety of systems and programming languages. Developed by AT&T in the 1980s, it became a software product of Oracle Corporation in 2008.

ATMI, for Application-to-Transaction Monitor Interface, is the main API for the Tuxedo system. It includes transaction management functions (routines, verbs); request/response, conversational, queuing, and publish-and-subscribe message-handling functions; service interface functions; and buffer management functions for distributed application communication.
