\subsubsection*{What it does}

A\+T\+M\+I, for Application-\/to-\/\+Transaction Monitor Interface, is the main A\+P\+I for the Tuxedo system. It includes transaction management functions (routines, verbs); request/response, conversational, queuing, and publish-\/and-\/subscribe message-\/handling functions; service interface functions; and buffer management functions for distributed application communication.

A\+T\+M\+I++ is a C++ wrapping of this A\+P\+I, adding strong typing of F\+M\+L buffers and adding the use of exceptions to detect and handle error conditions. This should help making it easier to write fast and rock solid Tuxedo software.
